**Michael Jordan: “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”**

## Why

Same as jedi training, the foundation of building resilience and supporting others in times of need is developing self-awareness and mindfulness. [Self-awareness has also been described as the new edge in performance](https://soles.michelin.com/self-awareness-the-new-edge-in-peak-athletic-performance).

Do you know that the human mind wanders off 40% of the time? And a drifting mind tends to lead to negative thoughts and emotion? Mindfulness, mediation, qi gong and similar practices have been supported by neuroscientific research to improve attention, mood and health.

If you’ve started mindfulness practicing, congratulations! Just like working out your muscles, persistence is the key for mind training also! Or if you haven’t got the chance yet, no worries. You can start anytime! Through these practices you’ll become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. And when strong emotions or ruminating thoughts arise, you could simply say to yourself “I’m aware of my thoughts… it’s coming and going...”. This technique is called decentering which helps you get less caught up by our transient mental states. Mindfulness is an experiential process. And it’s about experiencing the here and now.

## Exercise

Answer the following questions:

1. What could mindfulness practice do for you?
2. If you have done mindfulness practice, what benefits have you found?
3. What would make you set aside 5 mins a day to practice mindfulness?

If you have never done mindfulness practice, we recommend starting with 5 minutes a day. Guided meditation is available [here](https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful-meditations) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=guided+meditation).
