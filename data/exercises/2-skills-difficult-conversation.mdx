## Why

Like everything, improving and becoming comfortable with conversations takes practice. Talking about mental strength, mental health and emotions can be difficult. But they can also be easy. If you decide to take the challenge to run a marathon, and you can only run 5km today, you don’t start by running 42km, you start with something that is within reach, but a challenge.

When having a conversation you can use the [ALEC](https://hk.movember.com/mens-health/mental-health) process developed by Movember and R U OK. Here is a brief highlight on what ALEC stands for:

**A**: Start by **asking** how they’re feeling. It’s worth mentioning any changes you’ve picked up on - has the person stopped replying to texts, sounds different, has less energy or presence, looks withdrawn? Trust your instinct - people often say “I’m fine” when they’re not, so don’t be afraid to ask twice. You can use something specific like “Are you feeling ok? It’s just that you haven’t been replying to my texts, and that’s not like you.”

**L**: Let them know that you’re **listening** and give them your full attention (yes, please put down your phone). Let the person know you’re hearing what they’re saying and you’re not judging. You don’t have to diagnose problems or offer solutions, but asking questions lets him know you’re listening. Ask a question like “That can’t be easy - how long have you felt this way?”

**E**: **Encourage** them to focus on simple things that can improve how they feel. Is the person getting enough sleep? Are they exercising and eating well? Maybe there’s something that’s helped in the past - it’s worth asking. Suggest that the person share how they are feeling with others they trust.

**C**: Check in with them after your chat. This helps to show that you care, plus you’ll get a feel for whether the person is feeling any better.

## Exercise

To begin with, we can start with a conversation that you think is doable, but will give you a bit of a challenge.

During this week have a conversation with a friend or family member about one of the following topics, or something similar you prefer (choose something that you feel like you can do, but might challenge you a bit or be a new conversation among your friends/family):

### Easier Level - Discuss a topical mental strength or health issue, eg:

1. Did you see what Michael Phelps was saying about his mental health issues? Must be hard to transition when you finish your career so young [[Reference](https://www.insider.com/michael-phelps-mental-health-scarier-than-ever-during-pandemic-2021-1)]
2. I see Ben Stokes is back playing cricket after his mental health break. I wonder if it’s all the COVID bubbles or competing at that level [[Reference](https://www.cricket.com.au/news/ben-stokes-included-england-ashes-squad-injury-australia-tour-mental-health/2021-10-25)]
3. Do you that Keung To (from Mirror) just passed out in an event? And he’s talked about his depression openly
4. Is your work doing anything about mental health around COVID?
5. I saw that 61% of adults in Hong Kong suffer from poor mental well-being. Do you think that’s accurate [[Reference](https://www.mind.org.hk/mental-health-in-hong-kong/)]
6. I saw that 46% of people in Hong Kong believe that the main cause of mental illness is a lack of self-discipline and willpower. What do you think? [[Reference](https://www.mind.org.hk/press-releases/mind-hk-and-mindset-launch-more-than-a-label-to-combat-the-stigma-in-hong-kong-against-mental-illness/)]

### Medium Level - Go deeper, eg:

1. What do you do to help with your mental health? Do you meditate, exercise or other things?
2. Have you ever thought about the purpose of your career and where you are heading?
3. Some of these big environmental / social issues are really getting to me (or speak about a particular issue that effects you). Do you ever have similar thoughts?
