## Why

Many of us misconceive being harsh to ourselves is the way to make us stronger and better. Quite the contrary, self-compassion is the foundation of resilience. Research has shown that people who exercise self-compassion exhibit higher levels of emotional intelligence and are much more at ease even at times of turmoil. Self-compassion allows us to bounce back from setbacks as we don’t get too caught up by failures. Being kind to ourselves, particularly in times of difficulties, gives us the mental space to observe things with greater clarity, to learn from our mishaps, and to become better.
Another quality of self-compassion is the capacity of being vulnerable. As Professor Brené Brown debunked the myths of vulnerability as a sign of weakness, her research shows that "vulnerability is the core, the heart, the center of meaningful human experiences".
