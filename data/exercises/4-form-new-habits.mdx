## Why

Just like working out or healthy eating, if you haven’t been doing that, it takes time, persistence and skills to turn them into a habit. The same applies to mental fitness.

Here is an evidence-based approach to help you stick to your routine.

1. Write down the mental fitness exercise(s) you want to be part of your regular routine
2. For each exercise, put down

- Intention: Why do you want to do it?
- Action: When, where and how you will do it?
- Coping: What are the potential obstacles? How would you cope with them?

3. At the end of each exercise, write down the success factor(s) and process
   Below is a sample template you could use
   <Table>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>Activity Name</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>3 min meditation</Table.Value>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>Intention</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>Improve the clarity of my mind</Table.Value>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>When</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>6am every morning</Table.Value>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>Where</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>Living room at home</Table.Value>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>How</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>Following the audio guide</Table.Value>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>Potential obstacles</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>Want to sleep in… too tired to get up early</Table.Value>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>Coping method</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>
         <p>Go to bed by 10pm every night to get 8 hours of sleep.</p>
         <p>Set up an alarm to remind me to go to bed</p>
       </Table.Value>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>Success factor</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>
         <p>Went to bed before 10pm.</p>
         <p>Had coffee</p>
       </Table.Value>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <Table.Key>Process</Table.Key>
       <Table.Value>
         <p>Still a bit tired,</p>
         <p>but felt good of being able to accomplish what I set out to do.</p>
       </Table.Value>
     </tr>
   </Table>
